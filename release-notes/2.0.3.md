# 2.0.3 Release Notes

## Enhancements

* Added ability to set an exclusion list for site URLs:
  * Sites listed in the exclusion list will not have Secrets populated into the Username/Password fields by default. Secrets can still be populated in these fields by clicking the Green check icon to autofill. This should help prevent none username/password fields from having values filled in them automatically even if they are identified as username/password type fields
  * An “Exclusion exception” list also exists so specific pages on the site domain will still auto-populate as normal.
  * This can be set per-user or generally on the machine and WPF reads the information from a [local Json file using the web browser’s native services](../getting-started/native.md). This does require an additional .NET 4.5.2 app to help roll out the local JSON file.
    >**Note**: The user story is that the exclusion list is set to exclude a site at URL `Company1.site1.com` but has an exclusion exception for `Company1.site1.com/login.aspx`. In this case if they navigate to the login page then the secret will auto-populate in the login fields (if users only have 1 secret). After users login and go to any other page on the site that also has fields which are detected as username/password type fields, the Web Password Filler will not do anything unless directed by the user. This is to prevent the Web Password Filler from auto filling values in fields, when the auto fill action is unwanted.
* Added a new “Site” drop down option to the “Add Secret” dialog in the Web Password Filler, to allow users to select which Secret Server Distributed Engine site a Secret should be saved to (defaults to “Local” value)
