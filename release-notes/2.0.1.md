# 2.0.1 Release Notes

## Enhancements

* Added ability to check permissions for logged in users and only display options/folders based on those permissions.
  * Users only see the “Add Secret” option if they have permissions to add a Secret.
  * When adding a Secret, users see folders in the drop-down based on their permissions only and they won't see folders with “Read” permissions.
  * Secrets with "Read" access only have improved error messages.
* Improved support for Microsoft Online login sites that use multiple domains for Username/password logins on separate pages.
  * This applies for sites like login.live.com, microsoftonline.com, etc.
  * This is WPF side support for page “refer” links in page header.
* Added “alarm” notification for when users are reaching maximum session recording timeout of 2 hours.
* Modify back-end support for Refresh Tokens to use “alarm” based system.
  * This helps to prevent token read errors for the browser.
* Improved support for sites that force the username list to display on top of the Web Password Filler drop-down on the Username field (and prevent the overlap).
* Added additional “Remember for this site” options on WPF security pop-ups for sites with multiple domain logins.
* Security:
  * Access to folder names set up as javascript text code is sanitized to prevent code injection when accessing the folder on a system.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the “Refresh” icon is not displayed on the Secret list intermittently.
* Fixed styling issues for “Save your password” dialog for “Launchpad” site.
* Improved error handling and error message when no folders are found on “Add Secret” action.
