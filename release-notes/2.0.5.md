# 2.0.5 Release Notes

_March 30, 2021_

## Enhancements

* When you are logged into Secret Server and you click to log into WPF, a token is automatically generated for you. A window opens briefly showing the Generate Token button being pushed automatically, then the window quickly closes.  
* When you are logged into Secret Server and you click on a URL where you have a Secret configured, you can now be automatically logged into WPF, have a token automatically generated for you, and have your credentials automatically populated into the sign-in fields for the website.
* When you are logged into Secret Server and you click a URL from a Secret details screen, WPF now automatically populates your credentials for that URL without using the web launcher in the Secret.  
* When you are connected to WPF and you close your browser window without logging out of WPF, you will remain connected to WPF for a short time so that if you re-open your browser soon after closing it, you will still be logged into WPF.
* When you are logged into both Secret Server and Web Password Filler and you then log out of Secret Server, you are now automatically logged out of Web Password Filler.
* You can now specify one of two default positions for your pop-up Secrets list to appear: in the upper right corner of your window or just below the username field.
* You can now choose to have WPF require exact URL matches. If you choose this setting and the URL you browse to is not an exact match for the URL stored in the Secret, (for example https://commandcontroller.com/login.aspx instead of https://commandcontroller.com) WPF will not display the Thycotic checkmark logo and will not automatically populate your credentials into the website's username/password fields.
* WPF now more accurately populates your username/password credentials on web pages.  
* You can now manually refresh your list of available Secrets by right-clicking the Thycotic checkmark logo in a credentials field, clicking Secret Server Web Password Filler, and clicking Refresh Secrets.
* WPF will no longer validate a Native Messaging Host JSON file if the file is not in a valid format.
* Launching a new incognito window with session recording will not close other windows when this session recording ends due to a recording timeout limit (default 2 hours).  
* You can now check out Secrets from the Safari web browser. WHICH VERSION/RELEASE(S)? WHAT ABOUT SUPPORT FOR SESSION RECORDING OR WINDOWS ADMIN CENTER?

## Bug Fixes

* When you are recording a session on one or more tabs from an incognito browser window and the recording session times out, WPF now closes only those tabs where the sessions were being recorded, instead of closing all the tabs, including the tab with the connection to Secret Server.
