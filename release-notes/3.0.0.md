# 3.0.0 Release Notes

_July 17, 2021_

## Improvements

* **Session Recording**: Previously when a session recording was alive on a Chrome browser tab but the user was inactive in the browser for more than five minutes, Secret Server assumed the session had ended. Now a "heartbeat" is sent every two minutes to let Secret Server know that the session is still alive even though no activity is occurring.

* **Field Mapping**: Some websites use unconventional labels behind the scenes to identify their username and password login fields. In these situations, the Web Password Filler cannot automatically identify these fields. Users can now map (identify) these fields for Web Password Filler using drag-and-drop functionality.

* **Safari Support**: The Safari Web Password Filler extension now supports all functionality provided by the Chrome extension.

* **Switch to the logged-in Secret Server**: When a user tries to use Web Password Filler but they are logged into an instance of Secret Server that is not the instance associated with WPF, the application now prompts the user with the message, "Do you want to switch to the logged in Secret Server?" The user can then switch to the appropriate instance of Secret Server to complete their web login process.

## Performance Improvements

* Fixed performance issues users were experiencing when installing or re-enabling the WPF extension for their browser.
