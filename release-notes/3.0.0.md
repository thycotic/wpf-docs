# 3.0.0 Release Notes

_July 13, 2021_

## Improvements

* **Session Recording**: Previously when a session recording was active on a Chrome browser tab but the user was inactive in the browser/tab for more than five minutes, Secret Server assumed the session had ended. Now a "heartbeat" is sent every two minutes to let Secret Server know that the session is still alive even though the user is not interacting with it.

* **Field Mapping**: Some websites use unconventional labels to internally identify their username, password, and other login fields, and the Web Password Filler cannot automatically identify these fields. Users can map the fields on the Web page to the fields in the Secret using drag-and-drop functionality. To enable the field mapping function in the Web Password Filler, an administrator must add a new metadata section in Secret Server named WPFHints.

* **Safari Support**: The Safari Web Password Filler extension now supports all functionality available in the other supported browser extensions.

* **Switch to the logged-in Secret Server**: When a Web Password Filler user launches a Secret from an instance of Secret Server that is not configured for WPF, WPF now prompts the user with the message, "Do you want to switch to the logged in Secret Server?" The user can then switch to the appropriate instance of Secret Server to complete their web login process.

* **Performance**: Fixed performance issues users were experiencing when installing or re-enabling the WPF extension for their browser.

## Bug Fixes

* Resolved issues on Hivemanager.krome.co.uk where WPF was filling the key value incorrectly.

* Resolved issues on the workday website where the username field was not being populated correctly.

* Resolved issues on the Data Domain System Manager website where the username field was not being filled in. In situations where this still poses an issue, customers can now use the field mapping wizard to map the username field so WPF can recognize the field and fill in values from the secret.

* Resolved issues and validated that WPF can fill in values on https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/login/
