# 3.0.0 Release Notes

_July 13, 2021_

## Improvements

* **Session Recording**: Previously when a session recording was alive on a Chrome browser tab but the user was inactive in the browser for more than five minutes, Secret Server assumed the session had ended. Now a "heartbeat" is sent every two minutes to let Secret Server know that the session is still alive even though the user is not interacting with it.

* **Field Mapping**: Some websites use unconventional labels to internally identify their username, password, and other login fields, and the Web Password Filler cannot automatically identify these fields. Users can map the fields on the Web page to the fields in the Secret using drag-and-drop functionality. To enable the field mapping function in the Web Password Filler, an administrator must add a new metadata section in Secret Server named WPFHints.

* **Safari Support**: The Safari Web Password Filler extension now supports all functionality provided by the Chrome extension.

* **Switch to the logged-in Secret Server**: When a Web Password Filler user launches a Secret from an instance of Secret Server that is not configured for WPF, WPF now prompts the user with the message, "Do you want to switch to the logged in Secret Server?" The user can then switch to the appropriate instance of Secret Server to complete their web login process.

* **Performance**: Fixed performance issues users were experiencing when installing or re-enabling the WPF extension for their browser.
