Is the old Login Assist or Secret Server Clipboard Utility installed?

If **either** of the old browser extensions are installed it is recommended that you **disable** them from the extensions page. Once they are disabled you should **refresh** your page (or if possible, completely close and re-open the browser but if they don't want to lose work in other tabs you should be able to just refresh).

After the old extensions are disabled, please refresh or close the browser and then try again. Does it still occur?

If it still reoccurs it might be worth seeing what other extensions might be installed to see if they are interfering.

We recommend **NOT** running the new WPF at the same time as the old Login Assist and Clipboard Utilities are enabled. Since they are all effectively trying to do the same thing, they can end up conflicting with each other and cause issues. As a result, they should not all be enabled at the same time.
