# Support

Thycotic customers have access to support by phone and email. You also can open a case in Thycotic’s support ticketing system, which promotes follow-through to issue resolution.

>**Note**: Please see our [Support Services Guide](https://thycotic.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#37000000KAUl/a/1G000000TU6g/_z6_M8tD_6.x3JB2LOI8q20vzWkkiLhKbFv0Wec9Fw0) for details about our support policy. This page provides a high-level summary of portions of that guide.

Use the means you prefer, except for Severity 1 issues—for those, always use phone support.

  Severity 1 means a critical problem that has caused *complete loss of service* and work cannot reasonably continue at your worksite.

## Obtaining a Support PIN

To obtain support by email or phone, first log in to the Support Portal to obtain a PIN. The PIN validates that your license includes support, and you must provide the PIN in your email or when you call. The PIN also makes it easier for the person helping you to locate your customer records and give you better support.

* Visit the [Support Portal Login Page](https://thycotic.force.com/support/s/login/) using the credentials you received when you became a customer.
* After logging in, you will be on the main page. Click on the large blue bar labeled PIN to obtain a PIN number.
