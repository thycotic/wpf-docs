# Web Password Filler

The Thycotic Web Password Filler (WPF) is a Web browser extension to help users log on their sites. It allows browsers to find and enter credentials of users, when a Secret Server instance has secrets related to that website.

Secret Server stores credentials, as secrets, for different URLs. When you access a URL, WPF fetches the available secrets for that URL. You can then select the appropriate credential.

In addition to the login, WPF enables you to add a new secret or update an existing secret. You can use WPF to generate a strong password for a username. WPF includes a context menu for easy usage.

>**Note**: You can access the WPF extension from Secret Server too.
