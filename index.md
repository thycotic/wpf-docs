# Web Password Filler

The Thycotic Web Password Filler (WPF) is a Web browser extension to help users log on their sites. It allows browsers to find and enter credentials of users, when a SS instance has secrets related to that website.

SS stores credentials, as secrets, for different URLs. When you access a URL, WPF fetches the available secrets for that URL. You can then select the appropriate credential.

In addition to logging on, WPF enables you to add a new secret or update an existing secret. You can use WPF to generate a strong password for a username. WPF includes a context menu for easy usage.

> **Note:** You can access the WPF extension from SS too.
